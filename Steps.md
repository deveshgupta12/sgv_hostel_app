Steps to Push Code to Your GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to GitHub and sign in.
Click the "+" icon (top-right) and select "New repository."
Name it (e.g., hostel-management-microservices).
Set visibility (public or private).
Do not initialize with a README or other files (we’ll create them).
Click "Create repository."
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/hostel-management-microservices.git).
Set Up Locally:
Install Prerequisites:
Node.js (v16+): Download
MongoDB: Download
Git: Download
Create Project Directory:
bash

Copy
mkdir hostel-management-microservices
cd hostel-management-microservices
Initialize Git:
bash

Copy
git init
Create Files:
Copy each file from the artifacts above into the corresponding folder structure:
Create folders: frontend, student-service, room-service, booking-service, docs.
Save each file in its respective path (e.g., frontend/public/index.html, student-service/server.js).
Example for frontend/public/index.html:
bash

Copy
mkdir -p frontend/public
touch frontend/public/index.html
Then paste the index.html content into the file using a text editor (e.g., VS Code).
Repeat for all files.
Commit and Push:
Add Files to Git:
bash

Copy
git add .
Commit Changes:
bash

Copy
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up 3-tier microservices hostel management app"
Link to Remote Repository:
bash

Copy
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/hostel-management-microservices.git
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.
Push to GitHub:
bash

Copy
git push -u origin main
You may be prompted to log in with your GitHub credentials.
If your default branch is master, use git push -u origin master.
Verify on GitHub:
Visit your repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/hostel-management-microservices).
Ensure all files and folders are present.
Run the App Locally (Optional, to Test):
MongoDB:
bash

Copy
mongod
Frontend:
bash

Copy
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173.
Microservices (in separate terminals):
bash

Copy
cd student-service
npm install
npm start
bash

Copy
cd room-service
npm install
npm start
bash

Copy
cd booking-service
npm install
npm start
How to Provide Future Changes
Describe Changes Here: Tell me what you want to modify (e.g., "Add a delete booking feature," "Add student contact details," "Change UI colors").
I’ll Respond With:
Updated or new files with the changes.
Specific instructions for which files to modify or add.
A suggested commit message (e.g., git commit -m "Added delete booking feature").
Commands to stage, commit, and push the changes.
Example Request:
You: "Add a feature to delete a booking from the frontend and backend."
Me: I’ll provide updated frontend/src/App.jsx, booking-service/server.js, and instructions like:
bash

Copy
# Update files as provided
git add frontend/src/App.jsx booking-service/server.js
git commit -m "Added delete booking feature"
git push origin main
Security Note
Never share your GitHub credentials (username, password, or personal access tokens) here or anywhere else.
If you want to automate pushing code, consider using GitHub Actions or a CI/CD pipeline, which I can help you set up with configuration files (e.g., .github/workflows/deploy.yml).
Next Steps
Follow the steps above to push the initial code to your GitHub repository.
Let me know if you encounter any issues (e.g., Git errors, file setup problems).
Provide your first change request (e.g., new feature, bug fix) or confirm you’ve pushed the code, and I’ll generate the next set of files and commit instructions.
If you want a specific commit message for the initial push or additional files (e.g., .env for environment variables), let me know!
Please confirm your repository name (e.g., hostel-management-microservices) or share the public repository URL (if public) so I can tailor future instructions. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
